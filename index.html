        <p>2024 was a year marked by growth and a reaffirmation of core values at the Django Software Foundation. As board members, we remain dedicated to supporting, promoting, protecting, and advancing the Django Web Framework, with inclusivity and active community engagement at the forefront.</p>
        <p class="mt-[5vh]">Our key milestones from 2024 include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Getting Working Groups up and running:</strong> The <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/oct/13/announcing-dsf-working-groups/">creation and expansion of working groups</a> continues to foster meaningful contributions from our global community. From Code of Conduct to Social Media, we‚Äôre elated to see where our volunteers take the Foundation and our community.</li>
        <li><strong>Welcoming our new Fellow, Sarah Boyce:</strong> Her <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/mar/22/welcome-our-new-fellow-sarah-boyce/">appointment as Django Fellow</a> provides critical support for our project, driving timely development, community mentorship, and sustained innovation within the framework.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical governance reset:</strong> We <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/nov/14/technical-governance-challenges-and-opportunities/">responded decisively</a> to community needs by renewing our technical governance structure. Creating &quot;opportunities and onramps&quot; is essential, and our 6.x Steering Council elections exemplify our honest and hands-on approach to community engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>CHAOSS DEI Badge:</strong> Getting <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2025/jan/19/django-earns-the-chaoss-dei-bronze-badge/">recognition with the CHAOSS DEI Bronze Badge</a> is an amazing testament to our work on diversity and inclusivity, ensuring everyone feels welcomed and valued.</li>

        <h3>Launching Working Groups</h3>
        <p>With the working groups concept <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/oct/13/announcing-dsf-working-groups/">announced in late 2023</a>, early 2024 marked the formation of several DSF working groups, enhancing opportunities for community members to participate actively in shaping Django‚Äôs future. The <a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/social-media.md">social media working group</a> and <a href="https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/code-of-conduct.md">code of conduct working group</a> were the first two to launch successfully.</p>
        <p>The creation of the social media working group is a good example of our commitment to treat our communication efforts more seriously. This group is a critical step toward ensuring the Foundation&#39;s sustainability by enhancing our visibility and community engagement.</p>
